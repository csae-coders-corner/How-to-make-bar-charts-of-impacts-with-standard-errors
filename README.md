# How-to-make-bar-charts-of-impacts-with-standard-errors
Previously creating a bar chart with standard error bars was a multistep process requiring you to create the standard error range yourself and overlay two charts on top of each other. The command cibar makes this process simple. 
Letâ€™s say we want to plot a graph of impacts by two treatment groups. cibar takes the following syntax: 

	`cibar y, over1(treatment)`

And produces an output like this:

You can easily add the usual twoway graph options using the syntax: 
`cibar y, over1(treatment) graphopts(twoway graph options)`

For example: 
```
	cibar y, over1(treatment) ///
graphopts( legend( order(1 "Control" 2 "Treatment")) ///
xtitle("") ytitle("Mean Y") ///
title("Treatment effects on Y") ///
subtitle("Mean and 95% confidence interval"))
```

Which produces:

cibar also has the capability to show bar charts over multiple different groups using the options over2(group2), over3(group3) etc:

```
cibar y, over1(treatment) over2(female) ///
graphopts( legend( order(1 "Control" 2 "Treatment")) ///
xtitle("") ytitle("Mean Y") ///
title("Treatment effects on Y") ///
subtitle("Mean and 95% confidence interval"))
```

To produce something like this:

The command also has a range of capabilities to choose exactly how the bars, labels and legend look, so you can customise the chart to precisely your taste.
